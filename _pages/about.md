I am a postdoc at Swinburne University under the supervision of [Prof. Jinjun Chen](http://www.swinflow.org/jchen/). During my PhD I was advised by Prof. Jinjun Chen at Swinburne University of Technology. 
I focus on Differential Privacy.

Before that I got a Master degree advised by [Prof. Yongzhuang Wei](https://dblp.org/pid/96/9555.html) from Guilin
University of Electronic Technology, China and
obtained Bachelor of Science in Information Security
from Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications.

## My Research Interests
Differential Privacy (DP): DP Theory and DP Adaptations in Scenarios. Objective: to improve the trade-offs
between privacy and accuracy, to study the interplay between DP and other ethical
characteristics including security and fairness. 


Cryptography: Security Analysis of Block and Stream Ciphers. Objective: to reduce attack complexity of
SOTA algorithms such as block cipher including AES (ISO 2002), PRESENT (ISO 2007),
as well as latest released standards, and stream cipher including Grain 128a (eSTREAM
2004). Lattice-based Cryptography and its Application in Post-Quantum Cryptography.
